### Hey! I'm Umar! 👋🏾


- 📚 I'm currently a student studying Computer Science at CU Boulder and graduating in December 2021.

- 👨🏾‍💻 I'm also a part-time software engineering intern at [Leidos](https://www.leidos.com), working on projects using Python, PostgreSQL, and Docker

- 📱 Lately, I've been working on a sports calendar app called SportsCal. Check out the beta on [Testflight](https://t.co/YJ51MSBHwO?amp=1)!

- 📸 I love working on AR and last May I worked on an [AR Infection Simulator](https://twitter.com/umar__haroon/status/1385339656875565057?s=20) using RealityKit and since then, I've been trying to find new ways to work with AR
